o exit from the git diff output in PowerShell, you can follow these steps:

Press q: If the output is being displayed through a pager like less, pressing q will exit the pager and return you to the command prompt.

Press Ctrl+C: This sends an interrupt signal to the process, which can also stop the output and return you to the command prompt.

Try one of these methods, and you should be able to exit the git diff output and return to the PowerShell prompt.
